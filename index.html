                    <p> I choosed Kalyani Government Engineering College because of several factors.It is the best
                        college under WBJEE after Jadavpur University.It is located in Kalyani city which is not so far
                        away from Kolkata.The placements of our college is very good.Every year almost 80% students gets
                        their first job through campus placements.I choosed B.Tech in Electronics and Telecommunication
                        Engineering because it has a vast scope nowadays.I can go to the software industry and also to
                        the core industry for job.</p>

                        environment and support for being an engineer. The negative side of my college that my college
                        does not give sufficient placement in core for Electrical and Meachenical department. But other
                        four department i. e IT, ECE, MCA and CSE department got 80% + placement in campus requirement.
