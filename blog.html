                <h2>Our Certificate & Online Program For 2022</h2>
                <p>A graduate certificate is an educational credential representing completion of specialized training
                    at the college or university level. A graduate certificate can be awarded by universities upon
                    completion of certain coursework indicating mastering of a specific subject area. Graduate
                    certificates represent training at different levels in different countries and can be at bachelor's
                    degree or master's degree level.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A graduate certificate(GradCert, GCert, GradC) is a higher education qualification at the same
                    level as a bachelor's degree but more limited in scope, taking less time to complete - normally
                    between one third and two thirds of an academic year (or full-time equivalent). A longer period of
                    work (but still less than required for a degree) would lead to a graduate diploma.

                    The graduate certificate is positioned at Level 6 (bachelor's degree level) of The framework for
                    higher education qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and at Level 9 or 10
                    (bachelor's degree at ordinary or honours level) of The framework for qualifications of higher
                    education institutions in Scotland. In reference to the European Qualifications Framework, it is a
                    'first-cycle' qualification at the same level of knowledge and challenge as a first or bachelor's
                    degree but without the same depth and breadth of study.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Successful students will typically demonstrate some, but not all, of the kinds of skills, knowledge
                    and capabilities that would be expected for a Bachelor's candidate. Hence this certificate is not
                    considered to be an 'end-of-cycle' qualification (it demonstrates only some of the 'first-cycle'
                    learning outcomes).

                    Graduate certificates are available in a limited range of subjects that are typically work-related,
                    for example psychology, management, counselling or law.

                    Graduate certificates are normally taken by those who have already graduated with a bachelor's
                    degree in another discipline (hence the name). This qualification should not be confused with
                    postgraduate certificates or postgraduate diplomas, which are master's degree-level
                    qualification, or with certificates of Higher Education, which are lower-level qualifications
                    normally taken by those without previous HE qualification.</p>
